			<h2> HTML5 </h2>
			<p> I started with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> (Hypertext Markup Language) 5, and it was much easier then I excpeted it to be.  It only took a day or two to understand that basics.  I thought it would be best to start with this since its the basic of making a website.  You can make a website just with HTML but it'll be really, really ugly.  If you want your website to look better, you will need to learn CSS  </p>
